This includes an ItemTracker class designed to manage and analyze grocery inventory data. At its core, the program uses a std::map<string, int> to store item names as keys and their corresponding counts as values. This choice of data structure is highly efficient because it automatically keeps the items sorted alphabetically and allows for quick lookups when searching for specific products.The program's functionality is divided into several key methods. The LoadData function reads from an external text file, iterating through each entry and incrementing the frequency count in the map. Immediately after loading, the BackupData function exports these calculated totals to a file named frequency.dat, ensuring the processed data is saved for future use. For user interaction, the SearchItem method allows for manual queries of specific items, while PrintFrequencies outputs a simple numerical list of all tracked inventory.A notable feature is the PrintHistogram method, which utilizes the <iomanip> library to create a visual representation of the data. By using setw(12), the code aligns item names and then uses a nested loop to print a string of asterisks representing each item's frequency, effectively creating a text-based bar chart.The main function acts as the driver for the application, implementing a standard menu-driven interface using a while loop and a switch statement. This allows a user to perform multiple actions—such as searching for an item or viewing the histogram—within a single session. One minor technical detail to note is the syntax error in the LoadData parameter definition, where a period is used in a variable name; changing this to a standard string variable would make the code fully functional.
